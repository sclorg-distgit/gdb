Comments from Sergio Durigan Junior:

  The "proper" fix for this whole problem would be to backport the
  "ambiguous linespec" patch series.  However, it is really not
  recommended to do that for RHEL GDB, because the patch series is too
  big and could introduce unwanted regressions.  Instead, what we
  chose to do was to replace the gdb_assert call by a warning (which
  allows the user to continue the debugging session), and tell the
  user that, although more than one location was found for his/her
  breakpoint, only one will be used.
